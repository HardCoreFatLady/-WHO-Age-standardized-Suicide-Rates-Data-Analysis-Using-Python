# WHO Age-standardized Suicide Rates Data Analysis

I downloaded this dataset from the WHO website, which contains age-standardized suicide rates (per 100 000 population) around the world from 2000 to 2019. The data is divided by ‘Location’, ‘Period’, ‘Sex’ and ‘Value’.

With the development of society and economy, contradictions, conflicts, disasters, and the topics of life and death are all inseparable from the discussion in the historical process of human development. In addition to physical health, people's mental health can not be ignored either.

In my opinion, through the detection, analysis and evaluation of suicide rate data, national departments and organizations can carry out suicide prevention and targeted counseling in areas or groups with high suicide rate, so as to reduce the suicide rate.
